Welcome to the repository for the local 3D house design business website! This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to showcase our client's portfolio of completed projects and provide information on their services. The website was built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it looks great on all devices. It is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible to clients and potential customers alike. As the website is still in development, any feedback and suggestions for improvement are greatly appreciated. Thank you for contributing to this project!
