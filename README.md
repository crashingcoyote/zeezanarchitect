Hello and welcome to my first website project for a local 3D house design business! This website was built using HTML and CSS, and is still a work in progress. While JavaScript has not been implemented yet, it is planned for future updates. Additionally, the website is not currently fully responsive, but efforts are being made to improve its responsiveness. This project has been a great learning experience for me, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!
